# Key-Policy-Attribute-Based-Encryption-Leveraging-Isogeny-Based-Cryptography

Abstract. We present the first Key Policy Attribute-Based Encryption
(KP-ABE) scheme employing isogeny-based cryptography through class
group actions, specifically utilizing the Csi-FiSh instantiation and pair-
ing groups. We introduce a new assumption, denoted Isog-DLin, which
combines the isogeny and DLin assumptions. We propose the following
constructions: a small universe KP-ABE and a large universe KP-ABE
under the Isog-DBDH assumption, and a small universe KP-ABE un-
der the Isog-DLin assumption. In these constructions, the master key
is designed to be secure against quantum computer attacks, while the
ciphertext remains secure against classical computer attacks. This dual-
layered approach ensures robust security across classical and quantum
computational paradigms, addressing current and potential future cryp-
tographic challenges.
